#WWDC First Timer Guide#

Congrats! You've got a WWDC ticket. Every year the list of developers wanting to attend the conference yets longer and longer, and the ballot gets harder to succeed in.

Last year I read <a href="http://www.twitter.com/AndyDrizen">@AndyDrizen</a>'s guide <a href="http://odecee.com.au/making-the-most-of-wwdc-2015/">here</a> and decided I'd adapt it and add my own point of view on the conference.

## About the Conference ##
The conference is by far the biggest thing I've ever attended from a tech perspective, with over 5000 people attending, as well as a thousand staff and countless talks. 

It is by far the best networking and learning opportunity you will get as an iOS developer, so please try to make the most out of the opportunity.

## Pre-Conf ##
If you can, try to arrive on Saturday (or before if you like) as arriving on Sunday can lead to a very very busy day! And results in a very tiring Monday, especially if like alot of attendees are fighting jet lag. My advice - make sure you get out in the sun at lunch to wake you up, the dark conference center can put you to sleep, even during the best of the presentations.

### Registration ###
Registration can be done at Moscone Center West and usually opens on Sunday at 9am, and closes at 7pm. If you miss this, you’ll need to register on Monday morning, which means you might miss the start of the Keynote. This year's keynote is at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, so don't leave it to Monday!

During your registration, you’ll be handed some awesome Apple branded suprises, but also your conference badge. **Note:** As an Aussie - This is the only place I've used the Wallet app for Apple Watch. Don't miss out!

###Do not lose your badge.###
If you lose your badge, WWDC is over for you. You can beg an Apple employee to take pity on you, but I've never heard of anyone being successful in that regard. Alternatives include Altconf and streaming the conf from a coffee shop.

## Day 1: The Keynote, State of the Union, and App Awards ##
 
2015 was my first conference. The advice of other seasoned attendees was not to worry too much about the Keynote queue, but equally, not to arrive too late. It's a *looong* day so it's up to you.

Last year, we decided to get there early and arrive at 4:30am, and the queue was nearly already wrapping around the Moscone center. Even though we were warned about getting there early, we couldn't contain the excitement, and queuing added to the experience of WWDC. I met several other Australians and others in the queue that I shared lunch with often during the conf, and I recommend everyone doing it just for the networking.

The challenge with jetlag is that by 2-3pm you are really starting to feel it, and being in the dark conference hall is challenging!

This year Day 1 has been relocated to the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium and can hold 7000 capacity which means there will likely be no need for overflow rooms. It may mean queing is optional!

Last year, Monday consisted of three events:
<ul>
<li>The Keynote - The big show and tell for developers and media
<li>The State of the Union - The dev specific information which goes into more detail on the announcements
<li>Apple Design Awards - Apple's annual recognition of developers and apps
</ul>

Each event is about two hours long. After the Keynote, there is space to connect to ethernet and download all the latest versions of Xcode, iOS and OS X.

##Day 2: Breakdown Sessions##

Apple likes to release information in manageable chunks for developers and whilst Day 1 is the exciting reveal of all the new features, Day 2 is more for allowing developers to understand further all the new features and language changes, and empowering them to make decisions about which sessions to attend during day 3-5.

##Days 3-5##

###The Sessions###

There are over 100 sessions over the 5 days, and they run in parallel streams, so chose carefully. If you find there are two sessions which you want to watch at the same time, don't worry - as you can catch up with them via the iPhone / iPad conference app, as well as post-conference, or on the flight home - all the videos are downloadable on the Ethernet. 

Some of the sessions I made a last minute decision to attend last year were some of the most informative, so perhaps chose a couple of sessions which you normally wouldn't be interested in. Also, if you find 10 minutes into a session you are already losing interest, don't be afraid to walk out and go to another.

### The Labs###
I cannot under estimate the value the labs provide. Apple is a rediculously secretive company, and having the lab engineers available to answer your questions is fantastic. Take your project along and ask them any questions you have.

Having access to the Apple UX team to review your app and give you a list of improvements straight away worth the price of the ticket! These sessions sell out pretty quickly - Last year one of the team got to Moscone at 6am just to get his name on the list.

###Special events###
Last year Apple organised several extra talks during the lunch break, and also at the end of day 3. These included a women in tech get together, a talk by Debbie the creator of Goldie Blox, and also an animator from Pixar. These are quite entertaining and also inspiring, and are a good distraction whilst you eat your lunch.


###Other Things to Do###
##Pilgrimage to the Mothership##
Last year, we arrived at 11am from a 14 hour flight and by 1pm we had checked into our hotel, registered at Moscone, hired a car, and we were on our way for the 45-60 minute journey to 1 infinite loop. 

Apple HQ is the home of the original Apple store, and you can pick up T-shirts and momentos that you can't find anywhere else. Make sure you get a photo with the 1 infinite loop sign.

##WWDC parties##

There are a lot of parties during the week hosted by some of SF & The Valley's biggest companies. The party by Twiter / Fabric which was on the Monday night in 2015 is normally one of the biggest. 

Every night there is something different, and I also recommend these from a networking perspective... There's an awesome array of startups and companies willing to host, and they normally have awesome free swag, food & drinks.

Some of these events are extremely popular and sell out really quickly. Make sure you register quickly (normally on EventBrite).

## Other things to do in town##
<ul>
<li>Get breakfast at the Brainwash Cafe.
<li>Walk or cycle the Golden Gate Bridge.
<li>Walk through Chinatown.
<li>See the Sea lions Pier 39.
<li>Visit Alcatraz – Not free, but you can get a tour of this prison island. Be careful which tour you choose, as some of them just circle around the island, and don’t actually moor there.
<li>Climb Coit Tower for stunning views of the city.
<li>Eat at In and Out - Make sure to order of the secret Primal menu... 
</ul>

See some famous streets:
<ul>
<li>See some famous streets:Telegraph Hill – known for supporting a flock of feral parrots.
<li>See some famous streets:Filbert Street – one of the steepest navigable streets in the Western Hemisphere.
<li>See some famous streets:Lombard Street – a steep, one-block section with eight hairpin turns.
</ul>

##Other Information##
###Buy a local SIM card###
Getting a U.S. SIM card is pretty easy, and relatively cheap. Take a look at AT&T when you arrive - there's a handy booth that sells SIMs in the Westfield shopping center in Market Street.

###Safety###
San Francisco is generally a safe city, and I had no issues walking around on my own. However, there are areas such as The Tenderloin which is still in the process of being cleaned up. Many areas of the city - such as areas west of 5th Street, and South of Market have lots of homeless around and many people begging, so please be sensible when roaming the city and travelling between parties at night.
